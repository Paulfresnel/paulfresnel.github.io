            standard of quality, I bring innovative and out-of-the-box analytical and critical thinking that can steer decision
            making.

            In addition to my technical skills, I possess strong project management skills, including experience in project
            planning, team management, and risk assessment. I am also adept at communicating complex technical information to
            non-technical stakeholders and managing client relationships.
